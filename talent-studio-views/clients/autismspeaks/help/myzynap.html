<h1>HR Staff:</h1>
<p>Welcome to the new web-based HR solution. We are in test mode with this solution and would welcome your feedback and suggestions.</p>
<p>The solution is designed to support the following processes in the organization:
	<ul>
		<li><b>Employee Self-Serve:</b> Once rolled-out to the organization, employees will be able to log onto the system and manage their own demographic information, including addresses, marital status, education, skills, experiences, benefits choices, etc. Employees will also be able to complete self-evaluations, questinnaires and other forms on-line.</li>
		<li><b>Performance Management:</b> The system will allow the organization to complete performance appraisal forms on line. This includes the employee self-evaluation as well as the Manager's assessments. This information will be retained in the database and accessible to appropriate individuals.</li>
		<li><b>Benefits Enrollment:</b> The system will alllow for the on-line enrollment of benefits.</li>
		<li><b>Organization Charts:</b> The system automatically creates and updates organization charts.</li>
		<li><b>Other Information:</b> The system is flexible and will allow us to collect information on an ad hoc basis for use in other HR processes, including succession planning, skills/competencies inventories, and the like.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>We plan to roll this solution out to the Manager-level and above by October 1, 2009, and to the rest of the organization by November 1, 2009. There will be training prior to each roll-out so individuals will learn how to access and navigate the system.</p>
<p>Let us know what you think.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
