<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
Internal Audit's vision statement has three components: Governance, Partnership and People. As a group, we aim to be: 
<br><em><blockquote>"Recognized as an organization that attracts and retains top talent, develops our people and fosters their career development within Audit and throughout the Company."</blockquote></em>
</p>
<p><br>
The information on this system is used to support career development, Audit-specific aspects of performance management, as well as management planning and business continuity data needs. Consequently, information stored here must be accurate and appropriate. Guidance on how to use this system is available on our web site or by contacting the Internal Audit CAO team. Feedback on ways we can enhance aspects of this application would be welcomed.
