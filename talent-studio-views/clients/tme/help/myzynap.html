<h1>Performance & Talent Management</h1>
 
<p><b>
The Talent Management system provides a global process that ensures we are assessing and identifying top talent across the organisation.
Performance and Talent Management (P&TM) continues to be a priority for our business as we move from transformation to growth.
</b></p>
<p><b> 
Within the organisation this enables us to: 
	<ul>
		<li>Differentiate people based on their performance and their potential tracked over time</li> 
		<li>Identify talent earlier in careers enabling us to develop a diverse talent pool</li>
		<li>Obtain a common benchmark across the organisation to identify talent leading to more opportunities</li> 
		<li>Provide tailored and actionable development plans to meet the organisation's criteria for optimal performance</li>
	</ul> 
Talent management is a core part of the business cycle 
</b></p> 
<p><b> 
Whilst we clearly acknowledge that the fundamental aspect of P&TM is about having conversations with individuals, discussing their performance and formulating their development plans - this on-line system enhances this process, providing us with: 
	<ul>
		<li>A clear understanding of talent challenges and actions needed to address them</li> 
		<li>Visibility on key managers outside their own department - get to know the best managers</li> 
		<li>Well informed management planning decisions - right person in right position - with confidence</li> 
		<li>Calibrated list of high potentials and special initiatives to develop them</li> 
		<li>Divisional level reporting, providing you with the ability to access updated information on your key leadership community.</li> 
		<li>The ability to review progress on the quality of our information</li> 
	</ul>
