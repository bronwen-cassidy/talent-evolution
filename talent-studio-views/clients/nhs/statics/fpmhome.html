	        <br/>
		    Talent Studio has been chosen to provide the NHS Graduate Management Training Scheme with a comprehensive and configurable talent management solution that can be used to capture, integrate, present and assess employment, performance and career planning information for the trainees both whilst they are on the Scheme and in the future as their careers progress in the NHS.<br/>
		    <br/>
		    As the manager of our trainee for the duration of their flexi placement within your organisation, you are requested to complete a feedback questionnaire in order that we may monitor their progress.<br/>
		    <br/>
		    The feedback questionnaire should be completed during week 6 of the flexi placement.  Please refer to the User Guide for instructions on using Talent Studio.<br/>
