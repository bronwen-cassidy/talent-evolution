		<h2>Welcome to Talent Studio - the 
      Trainee Performance Portfolio </h2>
      Talent Studio forms the trainee's 
      performance portfolio that develops as they progress through the scheme, 
      capturing information such as performance reviews, progress in their 
      specialism competencies, placement planning, placement job descriptions 
      and objectives, personal development plans, academic achievements and 
      feedback from the Assessment Centre.
      <br><br>
      	The benefits of Talent Studio include:
      <br>	
      <ul>
        <li>Programme Managers are able to 
        remotely monitor their trainee's progress and performance for the 
        duration of the scheme even when the trainee is placed in another 
        organisation  
                   
                
        <li>Placement Managers are able to 
        access a range of information about their trainees from previous 
        activities and placements and are able to use this to form the basis of 
        their performance reviews and inform their personal development plans 
              
                 
                     
               
        <li>Most SHAs have now chosen 
        Talent Studio to support their Leadership Programmes allowing the 
        potential for trainees to be an integral part of the talent pipeline as 
        they progress through the scheme and on to further careers within the 
        NHS         
                    
                    
            </li></ul>

       <h2>Talent Studio Training and User Guide</h2>
 	Your Leadership Development 
      Manager should arrange training with you; this may be delivered as part 
      of a briefing or at a network meeting, or alternatively it can be 
      delivered via an on-line conferencing facility if you are unable to make a 
      face to face meeting.
      <br><br>	
 	Please contact your scheme area office to find out what options are available to you.
      <br><br>		
   	The Talent Studio User Guide should be used in conjunction with the Scheme Handbook which is located on 
      the Graduate Scheme Website.
      <br><br>	
 	Both the Handbook and the User Guide have been significantly updated so please take time to read them.
