		<h2>Welcome to Talent Studio - the Trainee Performance Portfolio </h2>
      
      Talent Studio forms the trainee's performance portfolio that develops as they progress through the scheme, capturing information such as performance reviews, progress in their specialism competencies, placement planning, placement job descriptions and objectives, personal development plans, academic achievements and feedback from the Assessment Centre. 
      <br><br>
      	The benefits of Talent Studio include:
      <br>	
      <ul>
                       
            
        <li>Placement Managers are able to 
        access a range of information about their trainees from previous 
        activities and placements and are able to use this to form the basis of 
        their performance reviews and inform their personal development plans</li>   
         <br>            
               
        <li>Some SHAs have now chosen Talent Studio to support their Leadership Programmes allowing the potential for trainees to be an integral part of the talent pipeline as they progress through the scheme and on to further careers within the NHS      
                    
                    
            </li></ul>
