	        <h2>Welcome to TalentStudio - the Trainee Performance Portfolio</h2>
		    Talent Studio is your trainees' essential NHS Career Tool created to support their development progress on the Graduate Management Training Scheme.<br/>
		    <br/>
		    It develops as they progress through the scheme, capturing information such as performance reviews, progress in specialism competencies, placement planning, placement job descriptions and objectives, personal development plans, academic achievements, feedback from the Recruitment Assessment Centre and your Orientation Plan.
			<br/><br/>
		    <h2>Talent Studio and Scheme Activities</h2>

            Email bulletins will be sent round periodically from your scheme area office to act as reminder of up and coming scheme activities and related Talent Studio actions.
			<br/><br/>
			<h2>Talent Studio User Guide</h2>

			The Talent Studio User Guide should be used in conjunction with the Scheme Handbook which is located on the Graduate Scheme website.   The User Guide is also included as an appendix to the Handbook but you can view it as a separate document from this page.
			<br /><br />
			Please note that both the Handbook and the User Guide were significantly updated in June 2008.
            <br /><br />
             All documents that were previously included on this page have been moved the Graduate Scheme website, including the Education dates and the Flexi Placements list.
