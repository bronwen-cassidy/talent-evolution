<i>Talent Management has been identified as one of the CPW three strategic people priorities.<br> 
In order for CPW to continue to grow, it is recognised that we need to take a more managed<br> 
approach to the way we identify, develop and retain key talent. </i>

<i>This on-line system will enhance our current processes by supporting management planning<br>
decisions, ensuring we have a calibrated list of high potential individuals and provide us with<br>
a mechanism for sharing information between businesses and functions about key individuals<br>
and their aspirations.</i>
