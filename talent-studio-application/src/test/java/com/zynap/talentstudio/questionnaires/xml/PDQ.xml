                Position Description Questionnaires (PDQs) are being distributed to all individuals
                who are included within the scope of the study. The information you provide on your PDQ will
                be used to develop new job descriptions and to determine the correct classification for your job.
                It is very important that you provide accurate, detailed information about your current job duties
            </narrative>
            <narrative>
                We suggest you begin by reading through the entire questionnaire so that you understand the information
                we are asking for in each section.Next, complete as much of the questionnaire as you can and then put it
                down for a day.On the next day, complete the rest of the questionnaire.Finally, just before you turn it in,
                read it again to make sure you haven't forgotten anything.
                We have included a checklist on page 2 to assist you with tracking your progress
            </narrative>
            <narrative>

            <narrative>
                You may complete your PDQ as an individual, or you may join with other employees who perform the same type
                of work that you do to complete the PDQ as a group.Contact your supervisor for specific details on how to
                participate through a group process.

                familiar with your job will have a clear understanding of what it is that you do. For example,
                do not simply state "prepares reports", but state "prepares reports such as status reports, staff reports",
                or other type of report(s) you may prepare.Also, please use action verbs such as prepares, calculates, operates,
                etc., to start off each statement. Avoid phrases such as "assists with" or "participates in" Do not use acronyms

                Example: Sally conducts property value estimates 20% of the time, it may mean she spends one day out of
                five on that task, or that she spends around two hours each day.
                These need only be estimates so do not spend a great deal of time trying to come up with an exact percentage.
                The percentages of all duties should equal 100% over a one year period of time.
