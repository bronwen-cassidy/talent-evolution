            <narrative>Lead a small project team including selection of team members, project initiation and planning, through to delivery and post evaluation, with supportive feedback to individuals and the team.</narrative>
            <narrative>This includes being held to account for the outcome to a Project Steering Group and the line manager i.e. senior manager or Executive Director or equivalent.</narrative>
            <narrative>This should be a ‘mainstream’ project with a relatively short timeframe for delivery which, therefore, requires a highly focused team. This can be a sub-component of a larger project e.g. one component of a review of unscheduled care to support Practice Based Commissioners or implementation of service/pathway changes to achieve national targets such as 18 week referral to treatment time or reducing healthcare infections.</narrative>
            <narrative>The success of the project should rely on effective networking with external stakeholders as well as laterally and vertically within the internal organisation structure.</narrative>
            <narrative>The required outcome for the project should be important to a wide range of internal and external stakeholders, including the Board.</narrative>
            <narrative>This should provide experience as to how to build personal networks and a team, and how to maintain an effective team, delegate effectively, inspire trust and commitment, and how to hold team members to account.</narrative>
            <narrative>This should also develop an awareness of how to tackle ‘difficult people’ issues.</narrative>
