Assumptions		
	This training program will provide for the creation and selection of courses for the BNY Mellon Audit Group	
	Within the program will be the following processes:	
		Within an artifact tab the courses for an individual that have been selected as part of his/her plan will be displayed
		The fields displayed will be variable and may not constitute all fields used in the training/development process
		The selection of a course will be part of a training process
		If a training course doesn’t currently exist, each individual is allowed to add a new course by filling in all the required fields
		This training process will allow the individual and the manager to select courses to be taken and individually approved by the 
			manager
		Once the training program has been approved, it cannot be deleted, but some fields can be changed for content revisions 
			(the name of the course as an example)
		Additional training opportunities can be added after the program has been approved. These new entries cannot be deleted 
			once approval has been made
		If the manager approving the program is not the OpCo manager, the additional approval from the person's OpCo manager is necessary
		If the training course is an in-house training program and offers CPE credit, a survey is mandatory
		If a survey is taken, at least one question must be answered for the survey to be valid
		Once a valid survey has been taken, a certificate is issued to the individuals portfolio for printing or review
		
	This is the basic process which is typically followed. Additional tools are required to fully benefit from the solution	
		A tool needs to be in place to allow the search and selection of the courses by the administrator to properly rename 
			or re enter a value. For example, the title used by a person to create the course may not be the actual title of the 
			course. A tool must be available to search of all of these discrepancies and rename them to the common and correct title. 
		A tool needs to be in place that allows the administrator to add courses to all or any number of people's training programs. 
			Field options that are modifiable after the course is created must be modifiable by the batch process. This includes 
			the ability to approve the courses at the manager and OpCo level. All approved courses with in the batch mode will be 
			stamped with the administrators user name.
		
	Other assumptions	
		All views will be modifiable
		The survey will be modifiable
		The certificate will be modifiable
		Individual fields will have tags that allow them to be locked, mandatorily filled in, modifiable after creation, 
		Training programs will be encapsulated so that more than one program can exist at the same time
		Training programs will be completed with the details saved in the portfolio for future reference but will be 
			unchangeable once they have been completed
		The administrator will have the ability to re-open any completed program; with proper person/date/time stamps of changes noted
